Stack Overflow is a very popular question-and-answer website, featuring questions on many different computer programming topics. Users can post questions and also provide answers to questions. Users who have earned certain privileges can also vote on the quality/helpfulness of both questions and answers. For each question (or answer), privileged users who have read the question can elect to provide either an “upvote” or a “downvote” for the question. The “score” of a question is equal to the total number of upvotes for that question minus the total number of downvotes.

After a question is posted, it would be beneficial for Stack Exchange to get an immediate sense of whether the question is useful or not. With such knowledge, the website could automatically promote questions that are believed to be useful to the top of the page.

In this project, I will build models to predict whether or not a question is useful, based on its tags and the title and body text data associated with each question. (To be concrete, a question is useful if its score is greater than or equal to one.)
